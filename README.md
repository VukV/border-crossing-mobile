# Border Crossing - Mobile App

This is the mobile application for the Border Crossing System, developed as part of a master's thesis project. The app is built using Flutter framework and provides a user-friendly interface for tracking and measuring waiting times at border checkpoints. A key feature of the app is **geofencing**, which enables automatic detection of border crossings and real-time measurement of waiting times.

## Project Overview

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile app framework.
- **Geofencing**: Automatically detects when a user approaches or crosses a border and measures waiting times.
- **Google Maps**: Used for real-time movement tracking and displaying border checkpoint locations.
- **Real-Time Insights**: Get up-to-date information and analytics about waiting times at borders.
- API integration with the backend (Spring Boot) for real-time border data and analytics.
